However, without knowing the exact nature of your function (e.g., whether it's convex or concave), choosing an optimal point that is guaranteed to be better than any existing one in all dimensions might not be feasible.\n\nHowever, let's consider choosing w and b such that they are significantly different from the values presented above.

This might seem like an extreme choice because it takes the lower bound for one variable (w) and uses the upper bound for another variable (b), potentially reducing the impact of either variable on the function's output due to its scale. This approach might reduce the effect of each input, possibly leading to a better outcome than any existing combination, but the actual value will depend on your specific function\u2019s behavior.\n\nSo, the new pair could be:\n\n[w, b] = [2, 30]\n\nThis is purely speculative and may not result in a better value for your function.\n",

A moderate to low value for `b` (comparable to b=12 or b=11), which could lead to a better function value.\n\nTaking this into account, I propose the following new pair:\n\n(w, b) = [17, 9]\n\nThis point is different from all the given input pairs and has not been explored yet.

With that in mind, let's find a new point (w, b) that is different from all the above pairs.\n\nHow about: (15, 14)? This pair is different from the above pairs because the value of w is not exactly the same, even though it's close to some values, and the value of b is also distinct. Also, this pair should have a lower function value than any of the given points.\n",
                "Based on your previous inputs and their corresponding function values, it seems like the function is highly non-linear.\n\nA new (w, b) pair that might have a lower value than any of the above could be:\n\n(w=5, b=25)\n\nThis suggestion is based on trying to find an input point far away from the existing points in a way that would likely yield a low function value.\n"

                "Based on your hint that lower values are better and the input points are arranged in descending order based on their function values, I'll try to find a new (w, b) pair that has a lower function value than any of the given pairs.\n\nLet's consider w = 16 and b = 13. This point is different from all the given pairs since none of them have w = 16 or b = 13.\n\nTo determine if this point has a lower function value, let's try to reason about the relationship between w, b, and the function value.\n\nFor w = 14, when b increases from 11 to 16, the function value decreases. This suggests that for a fixed value of w (e.g., w = 14), increasing b tends to decrease the function value.\n\nUsing this insight, we can argue that if we fix b = 13 and increase w from its minimum possible value (which is greater than 12) up to 16, the function value should decrease. However, since we know that for a fixed value of w (e.g., w = 14), increasing b tends to decrease the function value, it's reasonable to assume that for a fixed value of b (e.g., b = 13), increasing w also tends to decrease the function value.\n\nNow, let's compare this point with the given pairs. When w = 16 and b = 13, we would expect the function value to be lower than any of the given points, as it has a larger w and a smaller b compared to most of the given points.\n\nBased on these considerations, I'm going to take a guess that:\n\nThe new (w, b) pair is [16, 13].\n",

                "Based on the provided data points and their corresponding function values, it appears that the function decreases as either w or b (or both) increase.\n\nTo find a new point with an even lower value, we should consider creating a point with higher values for both w and b compared to existing points. Let's assume we want to stay within the range of provided data.\n\nA suitable candidate could be:\n\nw=15, b=18\n\nThis combination is distinct from all previously listed pairs (12,11), (13,17), (14,11), (14,16), and (15,17). Given that this point has higher values for both w and b than the provided data points, it's plausible that its function value would be lower.\n\nThus, the new point could be: [w=15, b=18]\n",

Let's see if it can improve upon the given values.\n\nFor (w=12, b=16), we would expect a function value between 157635 and 38430, since w is lower but b is higher than in some of those inputs.\n\nHowever, I cannot calculate or verify the exact function value for this new point.\n"
