In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, including natural language processing and generation. This master's thesis explores the innovative application of LLMs as optimizers in complex problem-solving scenarios. The primary objective is to develop an LLM-based optimizer that can effectively communicate with users, explaining its steps and justifying its approaches. This optimization framework aims to foster transparency and deliver more expainability for users.

The proposed system leverages the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to interpret user inputs and adapt the optimization accordingly. This dynamic interaction not only improves the accuracy and relevance of the solutions but also creates a collaborative environment where users can gain insights into the optimization process.

The expected outcome of this research is a transparent optimization tool that empowers users to understand and comprehend the optimization process. This tool is particularly useful in areas that require complex decision-making and problem-solving. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between advanced computational optimization techniques and user-centered design, contributing to the development of more intuitive and comprehensive AI systems.
